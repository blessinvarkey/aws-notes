# Scrum with User Experience 

### Key Frameworks in UX Design

# 1. User Centered Design ↓
User Centered Design puts the user front-and-center during the design process.

Four steps in the user centered design process:
- Understand how the user experiences the product
- Specify the user needs
- Design Solutions
- Evaluate the solutions you designed against the user needs

User centered design puts the user front and center in the user design process.

Guiding principles for User-centered design process:
1. Design for users and their needs (instead of what looks _cool_ to you)
2. Make your copy conversational (product design writing should be simple/conversational)
3. Present all the information clearly (easy navigation)
4. Acknowledge user actions (reward/pop up)
5. Offer support
