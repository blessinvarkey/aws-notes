User centered design puts the user front and center in the user design process.

Guiding principles for User-centered design process:
1. Design for users and their needs (instead of what looks _cool_ to you)
2. Make your copy conversational (product design writing should be simple/conversational)
3. Present all the information clearly (easy navigation)
4. Acknowledge user actions (reward/pop up)
