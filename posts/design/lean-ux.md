### 4. Lean UX ↓
The Lean UX process focuses on reducing wasted time and resources, and producing a workable product as soon as possible. 
The process is iterative, i.e. the team continues to update and make revisions to the product as they gather user research and stakeholder feedback.
Lean UX is about collaborating and incorporating feedback.

The Lean UX process can be broken into think, make and check.
Think: designing the product by creating sketches, wireframes, and prototypes.

Six principles of Lean UX:
1. Move forward.
2. Stay curious. 
3. Externalize your ideas.
4. Reframe deliverables as outcomes. 
5. Embrace radical transparency.
