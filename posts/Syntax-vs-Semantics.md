# Syntax vs Semantics

*"There is in my opinion no important theoretical difference between natural languages and the artificial [meaning formal] languages; indeed I consider it possible to comprehend the syntax and semantics of both kinds of languages with a single natural and mathematically precise theory."* (Montague, 1970 — “Universal grammar”, Theoria, 36: 373–398).   
*Everything in nature, both in the inanimate and in the animate world, takes place according to rules, although we are not always acquainted with these rules.* - Richard Montague
