# How to prepare for PSM I examination
I was exposed to scrum first time while developing an educational application in 2015. Our dev partners used the lightweight framework to deliver the project over 6 months. Since then I've worked on two scrum projects, one of which was my first attempt to introduce scrum to my project as a scrum master (instead of a PO).
The certification path doesn't require a background in scrum, however, an exposure or an intent to implement scrum your project can help prepare to pass the PSM in the first go.

To prepare for the exam, first, test your current understanding of scrum by attempting the free [scrum open assessment](https://www.scrum.org/open-assessments/scrum-open) by scrum.org. 

Then thoroughly study the [scrum guide](https://scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2020/2020-Scrum-Guide-US.pdf#zoom=100) and make your notes on it. Do note, each line, each word is important. 

After your study, go back to scrum.org take the open assessments and re-read the scrum guide until you consecutively score a 100%. Once you do, try the [Product Owner open](https://www.scrum.org/open-assessments/product-owner-open) and the Scrum [Developer open](https://www.scrum.org/open-assessments/scrum-developer-open) exam. 

Review the [scrum glossary](https://www.scrum.org/resources/scrum-glossary), especially the terms that you are not familiar with.  

When you feel confident and ready with your preparation, attempt the [Mikhail Lapshin's](https://mlapshin.com/index.php/scrum-quizzes/) 1 hour exam in Real Mode. Review the areas where you went wrong and go back to the scrum guide. Try scoring a 100% in every attempt.

Do note that the language used in the actual exam would be different from the mock and you might get a few scenario based questions too. However, the preparation should give you enough confidence to take the exam.
