# 6. Scrum with Lean UX ↓
Jeff Gothelff in his article [5 Rules For Integrating UX With Agile & Scrum](https://medium.com/swlh/5-rules-for-integrating-ux-with-agile-scrum-b048babb9a89) and [How UX design integrates with agile and scrum](https://medium.com/swlh/here-is-how-ux-design-integrates-with-agile-and-scrum-4f3cf8c10e24) describes how UX design integrates with Scrum: 

a. A dedicated engineer on every team.   
b. Teamwide exposure hours.    
c. Design work is first class citizen of the backlog.   
d. Outcomes as prioritization filter for the backlog.   
e. Cross functional participation in learning activities.

> 1. The product backlog contains the pieces of the broader vision that are not going to be worked on in the current sprint. High-level items, vision, and many assumptions live here. To inform the product backlog, activities like Design Sprints, Research (qualitative, all types) and hypothesis writing help inject both reality and a customer-centric focus to these items.
> 2. Sprint planning is the day-to-day level planning effort for the team. Questions like “What will it look like?”, “How will the product flow from screen to screen?”, “What are the exceptions we’ll need to deal with?” can be answered with design tools like Collaborative Sketching (aka “Design studios”, “charettes” etc) and other group brainstorming activities that UX designers are particularly good at facilitating.
> 3. The tactical Design work (capital D to serve as an umbrella for the various facets of product design) has to go into the tactical backlog — the sprint backlog — and is then executed by designers, primarily, but also in collaboration with the rest of the scrum team. The key is to prioritise this work in a way that allows all team members to work in parallel.
> 4. Critically missing from the core scrum team, and necessary for the integration of UX design, is a full-time designer on the team. The only way the tactics in #3 can happen in parallel collaboration with developers, product managers, and scrum masters is if there is a full-time designer on the team.
> 5. Sprint review is an opportunity to take a look, together as a team, at the output the team generated during the sprint. This is also an opportunity to review what we’ve learned during the sprint (aka the outcomes). Activities like design reviews, discussion, and debate of research synthesis and quantitative analysis inform the work we’re considering pushing live and help us focus our next round of both product and sprint backlog prioritisation.
