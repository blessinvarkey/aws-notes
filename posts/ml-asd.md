## Machine Learning and Computer Vision in Autism Spectrum Disorder Research 

The last decade has seen a substantial increase in the rate at which data is generated and produced. The growth in volume is due in the large part of the availability and infrastructure, used to collect and analyse many different types of information. 
The rise of computing power and processing technologies has also given rise to application of machine learning theories in different fields of study. One such field is ASD research. ASD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in social communication and social interaction in addition ot restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior.
