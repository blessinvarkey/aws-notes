## Bias
High bias can cause an algorithm to miss the relevant relations between features and target outputs (underfitting)

### Underfitting, Overfitting, Balanced

## Bootstrap
Bootstrap simulates obtaining many new datasets by repeated sampling with replacement from the origional dataset. 

## Bagging 

## Boosting
An ensemble learning strategy that trains a series of weak models, each one attempting to correctly predict the observations the previous model got wrong. 

## Bayesian Methods
- Works well even with small data.  
- Computationally costly in large data.  
- A prior must be chosen.   

# Machine Learning Models:

# Logistic regression 
- Used in classification problems 
- Predictive modelling algorithm
- It uses sigmoid function (logistic) to find the relationship between variables

# Support Vector Machine
- Can be used for both classification and regression problems but is mostly used for solving classification problems




# SOM
# t-SNE
# k-means
# PLS-DA
# random forests
