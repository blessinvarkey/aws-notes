# Bias
High bias can cause an algorithm to miss the relevant relations between features and target outputs (underfitting)

### Underfitting, Overfitting, Balanced

# Logistic regression 
- Used in classification problems 
- Predictive modelling algorithm
- It uses sigmoid function (logistic) to find the relationship between variables

# Support Vector Machine
- Can be used for both classification and regression problems but is mostly used for solving classification problems


# SOM
# t-SNE
# k-means
# PLS-DA
# random forests
